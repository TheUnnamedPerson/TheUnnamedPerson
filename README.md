<h1 align="center">Hello! I'm Fernando Fonseca</h1>
<h3 align="center">Software Developer</h3>

Please Note That ALthough My Github Account has Existed for a While Now, I Only Became Active A Little Bit Ago and Almost None of My Projects Are On Here.

Also Note That I Do a Lot of Contribution to Private Repos So The Stats Visible Here Don't Reflect What I've Actually Contributed To

Lastly, If You Have Any Questions Regarding Work in the Aforementioned Private Repos Feel Free To Ask.
If I Have Clearence for the Specific Project Then I'll Give Details.

Currently Working On:
 - Robotics Code For [**Avenir Innovations**](https://github.com/Avenir-Innovations)
 - A "Game" That Serves as a Personal Project, No Link For Now Since It's Just Me But Being Doing it On and Off for 4 Years Now In C# and UWP.
 - [**A Small Text-Based Console Game on Replit**](https://replit.com/@FernandoFonsec8/CAMS-RPG) That I Only Ever Work on During My Freetime. Shenanigans.

Would Prefer to Keep My Other Personal Projects Private But If Requested I May Give Information.
